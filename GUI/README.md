# Web Page GUI - Team RoboPot

Hello!

Welcome to the web page directory for team RoboPot! This readme file is going to explain how to get this web page up and running as well as explaining some of the main factors when creating and compiling it.

If you're like myself and new to web page development, the best way to learn is to start working on your own web page for a hobbyist project like ours. There are great resources out there such as W3Schools to help you out as well!

### Defining features
